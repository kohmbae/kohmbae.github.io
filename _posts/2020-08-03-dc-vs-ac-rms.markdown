DC stands for direct current, and it means that electrons flow in a single direction. As the battery runs out of energy, the output voltage will drop, but the polarity will remain the same. Polarity defines the positive direction. <br/> <br/>
AC stands for alternating current, and it means that the flow of electrons changes. For a sinusoidal waveform, the polarity changes, when the voltage reaches zero. The change from start to finish is called a cycle. The rate at which cycle repeats is frequency, which uses Hz (cycles per second).

RMS = Root Mean Square = Effective value of a varying voltage or current.<br/>
In detail, RMS value is equivalent to the steady DC value.<br/>
It is good to remember RMS value, instantaneous voltage, and phasor voltage given by a sinusoidal input.
