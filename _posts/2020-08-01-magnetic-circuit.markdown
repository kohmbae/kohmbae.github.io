1. Magnetic flux describes the number of magnetic field lines that passes through a given area. A magnetic field does not represent a flow of anything. A magnetic field is a vector field that represents the magnetic influence of the current. If the current is DC, the resultant magnetic field has a constant orientation. DC or static lines of magnetic flux naturally emerge from the earth and allows the compass to indicate the magnetic north. On the other hand, AC magnetic field varies in direction and intensity over the time. No power is dissipated in reluctance. <br/>
Electric current represents the flow of electrons, and carry power. The power is dissipated in the resistance.
1. The magnetic permeability outside the material matters. Not all of the magnetic field is fined to the magnetic circuit. Leakage flux in the space outside the magnetic cores can be a serious issue. <br/>
In electrical circuit, the leakage of current is usually very little.
1. Magnetic circuit is non-linear. The reluctance does not remain constant and varies based on the magnetic field. When a ferromagnetic material reach to the saturation, a reluctance increases rapidly. Ferromagnetic material suffers from flux and, therefore, flux depends on the history of MMF not the instantaneous MMF. Even though the external magnetic field does not exist, magnetization can be left behind in the ferromagnetic material.

Static electric field : EMF = 0 <br/>
Time-varying electro-magnetic field : EMF = - N * dÏ•/dt
