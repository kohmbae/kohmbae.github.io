Force
-	Force is a push or pull on an object.
-	It can move a stationary object or stop a moving object.
-	Force can also change the speed and direction of a moving object.
-	Force is the capacity to do work or cause physical change
-	F = ma.

<br/>
Work
-	When force is applied on an object, resulting in the movement of that object, work is said to be done.
-	Work = force * distance * cosÎ¸
-	Work is done on an object when you transfer energy to that object.

<br/>
Energy
- The ability or the capacity to do work is called energy
  - The food that we eat gives us energy to do various activities.
- Kinetic Energy = Energy of motion
- Potential Energy = Stored energy

<br/>
Power
- Power is the work done in a unit of time.
<br/>

Electric work <- Electric force <- Electric charge <- Electrification <- External energy

<br/>
Electrification (= charging)
- In a neutral atom, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons. When an atom is electrically neutral, the overall charge of the atom is zero.
- By applying friction, conduction, or induction on the object, the object can gain or lose electrons. The process of supplying electrons to or losing electrons from an object is called charging.

<br/>
<br/>
Coulomb's law
- $$F = {k * Q1 * Q2 \over r^2} [N]$$
- The magnitude of the electrostatic (= electric charges at rest) force of attraction or repulsion between two charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitude of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

The idea of electric field starts with the question how the two objects exert forces on each other across vast distance?
The way charges talk to each other is with the electric field.
1. &nbsp; The charge Q1 creates an electric field all around it, whether there are other charges nearby or not. The electric field gets weaker and weaker the farther the charge goes. If there is only one Q1, this charge is not going to exert a force on itself. Q1 will exert a force on any other charges that is around to its electric field.
- 	Electric field is not electric force. Electric field can cause an electric force on other charges.
2.	&nbsp; Now, assume there is another charge Q2 around Q1. Electric field of Q1 causes an electric force on a charge Q2. Also, electric field of Q2 causes an electric force on a charge Q1.
- The charge Q2 does not have to know the existence of charge Q1. The charge Q2 only concerns about existing electric field.
- The electric field at a point in space is defined to be the amount of electric force per charge exerted at that point in space. So, the definition of electric field is amount of electric force per charge. In other words, electric field tells you how many newtons of force you would get per coulomb, which is SI unit of electric charge.

<br/>
<br/>
Electric potential energy is the energy that is needed to move a charge against an electric field.
<br/>
Electric potential energy = k * charge that creates the electric field * test charge / distance from the reference point
<br/>
<br/>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential
<br/>
<br/>
An electric potential is the amount of work needed to move a unit of charge from a reference point to a specific point inside the field without producing an acceleration.
<br/>
<br/>
Electric potential = Electric potential energy / test charge
<br/>
Electric potential = k * charge that creates the electric field / distance from the reference
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color:red">Voltage</span> = Electric potential difference
