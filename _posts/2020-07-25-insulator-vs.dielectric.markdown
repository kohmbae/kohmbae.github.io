<br/>
In common
<br/>
Insulators and dielectrics are materials whose atoms have tightly bound electrons, not free electrons.
<br/>
<br/>
In difference
<br/>
The term insulator is generally used to indicate electrical obstruction while the term dielectric is used to indicate the energy storing capacity of the material (by means of polarization) A good dielectric is the material which is easily polarized and is not about being more insulated.
