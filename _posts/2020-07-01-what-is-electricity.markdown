## What is electricity?		
---  
Electricity is the presence and flow of electric charge.

Electricity is a transmission medium for electrical energy.

Electrical Energy is a form of energy that we use to operate electrical loads.
<br/>
<br/>

### There are two types of electricity: static and dynamic.

<br/>

Static electricity is the result of an imbalance of electric charges on the surface of objects.
<br/>

-	The charges remain until they can be released by using electric current or electrical discharge.
-	Electrostatic discharge is one of the examples of electric discharge phenomena.
<br/>

#### How does static electricity work?

1. &nbsp; Friction, pressure, heat, or other external force can give bound electrons enough energy to leave their atoms and to move toward other surface of materials.
-  &nbsp; Insulators consist of atoms with tightly bound electrons.
-  &nbsp; Conductors consist of atoms with weakly bound outer electrons.
2. &nbsp; If the free electrons are gone, this object is left with more protons than electrons and, thus, becomes positively charged. The object with more electrons become negatively charged. All charged objects have an imbalance of charge - either more electrons than protons or vice versa.
-  &nbsp; Static build-up is likely to occur when one of the materials involved is an insulator.
3. &nbsp; Nature tends toward balance. When positively charged object contacts with a negatively charged object, the free electrons will move to the object that they are most needed to restore the neutral charge equilibrium. The quick movement of electrons is called elect	rostatic discharge.

<span style="color:blue">__Dynamic electricity__</span>

Dynamic electricity refers to the flow of electric charges of through a conductor. Electric current is the rate of flow of electric charges.
-   $$ I= \frac{dQ}{dT},\quad I= \frac{Q}{T}\quad for\;steady\;flow\;of\;charges$$
