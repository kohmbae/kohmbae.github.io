## <span style="color:red">Gauss's Law, instead of Coulomb's Law, to calculate the Electric field</span>		
---  
Instead of utilizing Coulomb's Law, which requires a lot of integrations, I focused on Gauss's Law to calculate the Electric field. To use Gauss's Law, the source that produces the electric field must have a high degree of symmetry.

Gauss's Law
<br/>
The total of the electric flux out of a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by the permittivity.
- Flux describes how much of things go through a certain area. Electric flux measures the number of electric field lines (electric lines of force) passing through an area.

- Permittivity is a measure of the electric polarizability of a dielectric. Polarizability is the ability to form instantaneous dipoles. Materials with higher permittivity polarizes more, and, therefore, store more energy in the material, when external electric field applied.
