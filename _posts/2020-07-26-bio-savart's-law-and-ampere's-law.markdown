<br/>
Bio-Savart law can describe the magnetic field generated by a constant electric current, which occurs at DC not AC. The law considers the magnitude, direction, length, and proximity of the electric current to calculate the magnetic field. The role of Bio-Savart law is similar to that of Coulombâ€™s law.

http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/magnetic/amplaw.html
For a symmetric closed loop, the integral(sum) of the length elements times the magnetic field in the direction of the length element is equal to permeability times the electric current enclosed in the loop.
-	Magnetic permeability is the ability of a material to create an internal magnetic field.
