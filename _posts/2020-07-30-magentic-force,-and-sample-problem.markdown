Magnetic forces on moving charges
https://ef.engr.utk.edu/hyperphysics/hbase/magnetic/movchg.html
The magnetic field exerts the magnetic force on free moving charges. The magnetic force on a free moving charge is perpendicular to both the velocity of the free moving charge and the magnetic field. The force is given by the charge times the vector product of velocity and magnetic field. When a charge is stationary or is moving parallel to the magnetic field, the magnetic force is zero.
